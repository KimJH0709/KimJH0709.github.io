Forward the command from admin-page to the Client. Forward the client’s information to the admin-page so that it can be viewed. Client(collector) Collect and send HW information, SDK information, and RESOURCE information of the currently installed device to the server. Of these, RESOURCE information is sent in a user-defined time cycle (default 5 minutes). When the server receives a command and receives a PID, it terminates that PID. After that, update the RESOURCE information once again and send it to the server. Take the command from the server, capture the screenshot, and forward it to the server.
